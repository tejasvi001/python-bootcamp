# We use conditionals in Python to check a conditions and tell the computer what to do in each case. e.g.
#
# if <this condition is true>:
#
#     <then execute this line of code>
#
# What if the condition is false?
# The else keyword is used to define a block of code that will execute if the condition checked in the if statement is false.
#
# if pigs can fly:
#
#     <Some code that will never execute>
#
# else:
#
#     print("This is real life")
#
# Python Indentation
# Understand the importance of indentation in Python as a way to make certain lines of code subsidaries of other lines of code.
#
# e.g.
#
# if 5 > 2: #This is a parent line of code
#
#     print("yes") #this is a child line of code


# Comparator Operators
# > Greater than
# < Less than
# >= Greater than or equal to
# <= Less than or equal to
# == Equal to
# != Not equal to
print("Welcome to the rollercoaster!")
height = int(input("What is your height in cm? "))

if height >= 120:
    print("You can ride the rollercoaster")
else:
    print("Sorry you have to grow taller before you can ride.")
